# Hi, I'm Tom Rawson! ðŸ‘‹

Below is all about the task i worked on the Zuri Javascript Carousel/Slideshow repo

# Project Title

Zuri Javascript Carousel/Slideshow 

# Description

I Created a Carousel/Slideshow with 6 different images of my choice.

# Documentation

We were instructed to creat a responsive carousel where the images are properly styled. Directional icons (previous and next Icons ) are shown on the images only when hovered
On clicking the icons, it should show the next/previous image. When the next icon on the last image is clicked, it should show the first image.
When the previous icon on the first image is clicked, it should show the last image. The task was push here to github and I also hosted rendered the codes on git pages.
